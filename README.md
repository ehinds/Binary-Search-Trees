Contains a default constructor that opens a file county_data.txt and adds these values into two separate binary search trees,
one sorted by county name and the other sorted by population size, using insert functions. Contains a search function to search the county sorted
bst by county name, insert functions for inserting into both binary search trees, delete function for deleting individual entries from both search trees,
a delete all function for both trees for use in the destructor, a population_range function that prints all of the information with population sizes
between a specified min and max value in the parameter section, sorted only by county name, a print_tree function that prints both search trees 
to the screen (county and population size sorting), and a sorted_info function that creates a file called county_info.txt and prints 
the county sorted bst information to this file.
